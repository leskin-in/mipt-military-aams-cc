# AA-CC operations

This directory contains an example of system operation.

`self.sql` setups the positions of defended objects (Sheremetyevo airport) and SAM systems.

`fr24data.sql` is an autogenerated file which contains data from several real flights tracked by FlightRadar24. On INSERT, a trigger is activated, and missiles are launched automatically.

`parse_fr24_data.py` is a script to parse arbitrary FlightRadar24 data files in CSV format. It converts such data into SQL requests.
